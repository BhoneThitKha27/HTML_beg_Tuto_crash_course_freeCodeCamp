# What I Learned from the HTML Beginner Crash Course

Throughout this crash course, I had the opportunity to explore the basics of HTML and gain a better understanding of how webpages are structured. While I still have much to learn, this experience helped me build a solid starting point.

## Key Topics I Covered

- **HTML Document Structure**
  - Learned how a typical HTML file is built using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

- **Text and Headings**
  - Practiced using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`) to format content properly.

- **Links**
  - Gained familiarity with creating clickable links using the `<a>` tag and understanding how to link both internal and external pages.

- **Images**
  - Learned how to embed images using the `<img>` tag and the importance of the `alt` attribute for accessibility.

- **Lists and Tables**
  - Used `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` for lists, and explored basic table elements like `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.

- **Forms**
  - Practiced creating simple forms with `<form>`, `<input>`, and other elements like checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

- **HTML Attributes**
  - Got introduced to attributes such as `href`, `src`, `alt`, `id`, and `class` and how they enhance elements.

- **Comments and Clean Code**
  - Learned how to use `<!-- comments -->` and picked up simple practices to keep code clean and readable.

## Final Thoughts

This crash course gave me a practical introduction to HTML. I now feel more comfortable reading and writing basic HTML code, and I look forward to improving further by building more projects and learning CSS and JavaScript next.
